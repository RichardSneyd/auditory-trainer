        <h2>What is NeuroTune? </h2>
        <p>NeuroTune is a free Auditory Processing Trainer! Just select your prefered audio file - we recommend calming, stimulating classical music, but it's your choice! NeuroTune trains your auditory system by dynamically modifying the audio in ways that stimulate interhemispheric communication, and 'surprise' the auditory system, since these shifts are dynamic and unpredictable. Frequencies in the human vocal range are emphasised, while 'noisy' ones are reduced, thus training the brain to focus on spoken sounds, and filter out background noise. Over time, the idea is that this trains the auditory system to tune in to what it hears, discriminating between different sounds much more easily.</p>
           
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Filter Frequency Range</strong>: Allows you to set a minimum and maximum frequency in Hertz (Hz), focusing on a specific range of sound frequencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Gating Frequency Range</strong>: Enables you to set the minimum and maximum gating frequency in seconds, adjusting how the sound is processed over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Volume Control</strong>: Gives you the ability to control the volume through a slider, ensuring that the audio levels are to your liking.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Filter, Gating  & Playback Rate Switch</strong>: These options let you enable or disable dynamic filtering and gating, as well as dynamic playback speed, offering further customization to your auditory training. High-pass filtering and gating are on by default.</li>
        </ul>
